# Survey Form Project
This is a survey form project that I created using HTML and CSS as part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Design certification curriculum. The form includes various input fields such as text boxes, radio buttons, and dropdown menus, and is designed to gather user feedback on a specific topic.

# Technologies Used
The project was built entirely using HTML and CSS. No external libraries or frameworks were used.

# Features
The survey form includes the following features:

- A clear and concise form layout that is easy to navigate
- Input validation to ensure that all required fields are filled out correctly
- Responsive design that adjusts to various screen sizes
- Styling that is consistent with the theme and purpose of the form
# How to Use
To use the survey form, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The form can be completed by filling out the various input fields and clicking the submit button. Any errors or omissions will be highlighted and must be corrected before the form can be submitted.

# Future Improvements
While the survey form meets the basic requirements of the FreeCodeCamp certification project, there are several potential areas for improvement, including:

- Enhancing the styling and visual appeal of the form
- Adding additional validation and error messages to guide users
- Incorporating JavaScript functionality to enable more dynamic behavior
